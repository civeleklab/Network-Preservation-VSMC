# Network-Preservation-VSMC
Network preservation analysis reveals dysregulated metabolic pathways in human vascular smooth muscle cell phenotypic switching

# RNA sequencing data of aortic smooth muscle cells isolated from 151 heat transplant donors from distict gentic ancestries cultured in quiescent and prolierative conditions
GSE193817

# Weighted Gene Coexpression Network Analysis
WGCNA_VSMC_huVSMC.R
This script was used for running coexpression network analysis on both the quiescent and proliferative RNA sequencing datasets. Datasets are analyzed separately with dataset specific parameters identified during the analysis. Gene expression data was log2 transformed prior to the start of the anlaysis.

# Network Preservation Analysis
Preservation_Analysis_huVSMC.R
This script analyzes network preservation statistics between the WGCNA Modules created from the quiescent and proliferative RNA sequencing datasets.
